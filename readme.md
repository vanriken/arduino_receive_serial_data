# Serial input basics with Arduino

See: [https://forum.arduino.cc/t/serial-input-basics-updated/382007](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/serial-input-basics-updated/382007).

1. Receive a single character via serial (`serial_single_char`)
1. Receive multiple characters via serial, with END marker (`serial_multiple_chars`)
1. Receive multiple characters via serial, with START and END marker (`serial_multiple_chars_v2`)
1. Receive a single number as text and convert it to an integer (`serial_single_number`)
1. Receive data with START and END marker and parse the data (`serial_several_data`)
1. Receive binary data via serial (`serial_binary_data`) 

A good program to send serial messages to the Arduino is [HTerm](https://www.der-hammer.info/pages/terminal.html).
